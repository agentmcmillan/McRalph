# Planning Enhanced: Brain-Wave Integrated

You implement Manus-style persistent markdown planning with Brain-Wave memory integration.

## Core Enhancement

Planning files now sync bidirectionally with Brain-Wave:
- `findings.md` → `rem/discoveries/`
- `task_plan.md` references `alpha-wave/INDEX.md`
- `progress.md` → `rem/sessions/`

## Pre-Execution: Load Brain-Wave Context

```bash
echo "=== Planning with Brain-Wave Context ==="
test -f alpha-wave/INDEX.md && echo "✓ File index available - will reference in plans"
test -f beta-wave/_MAP.md && echo "✓ Architecture available - will inform planning"
test -f rem/discoveries/ && echo "✓ Prior discoveries available - will build on"
```

## Enhanced Planning Files

### task_plan.md (Enhanced)
```markdown
# Task Plan: [Title]
> Created: [timestamp]
> Brain-Wave Context: Loaded ✓

## Brain-Wave References
- Index: @alpha-wave/INDEX.md
- Architecture: @beta-wave/_MAP.md
- Patterns: @beta-wave/_PATTERNS.md

## Project Context (from Brain-Wave)

### Relevant Files
[Auto-populated from alpha-wave/INDEX.md based on task]

### Architecture Notes
[Auto-populated from beta-wave/_MAP.md]

### Known Constraints
[Auto-populated from beta-wave/_DECISIONS.md]

### Prior Related Work
[Auto-populated from rem/discoveries/]

## Phases

### Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task 1.1
  - Files: [from index]
  - Pattern: [from patterns]
- [ ] Task 1.2
  - Files: [from index]
  - Depends on: [from connections]

### Phase 2: [Name]
[continues...]

---

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All tasks checked
- [ ] Findings synced to rem/discoveries/
- [ ] Progress synced to rem/sessions/
```

### findings.md (Enhanced)
```markdown
# Findings: [Task]
> Created: [timestamp]
> Syncs to: rem/discoveries/planning.md

## Research Findings

### From Brain-Wave (Pre-loaded)
[Relevant prior discoveries from rem/discoveries/]

### New Discoveries

#### [timestamp] - [Finding Title]
- **Context**: [what was being investigated]
- **Discovery**: [what was found]
- **Evidence**: [files/code that shows this]
- **Implications**: [what this means]
- **Sync Status**: [ ] Synced to REM

---

## Architecture Insights
[New understanding about the system]
→ Sync to: rem/discoveries/architecture.md

## Pattern Observations
[New patterns discovered]
→ Sync to: beta-wave/_PATTERNS.md (suggest update)

## Issues Found
[Problems discovered]
→ Sync to: rem/discoveries/issues.md

---

## Auto-Sync Summary
When planning completes, these findings will be appended to:
- rem/discoveries/planning.md (all findings)
- rem/discoveries/architecture.md (architecture insights)
- rem/discoveries/issues.md (issues found)
```

### progress.md (Enhanced)
```markdown
# Progress: [Task]
> Created: [timestamp]
> Syncs to: rem/sessions/planning-[timestamp].md

## Session Log

### [timestamp] - Session Start
- Brain-Wave context loaded
- Prior state: [from rem/restoration/PROTOCOL.md]
- Focus: [what we're working on]

### [timestamp] - [Activity]
- Phase: [current phase]
- Tasks completed: [list]
- Discoveries: [brief]
- Next: [what's next]

---

## Metrics
- Tasks completed: [N]/[Total]
- Phases completed: [N]/[Total]
- Discoveries made: [N]
- Issues found: [N]

## Session End Summary
[Auto-generated when /clear or task complete]
→ Syncs to: rem/sessions/planning-[timestamp].md
```

## Workflow Integration

### Starting a Planning Session

```bash
# 1. Load Brain-Wave context
cat alpha-wave/INDEX.md
cat beta-wave/_MAP.md
cat rem/discoveries/

# 2. Create planning files with context
mkdir -p .planning
# Generate task_plan.md with Brain-Wave references
# Generate findings.md with prior discoveries
# Generate progress.md with session template
```

### During Planning

When user works on tasks:
1. Reference files from `alpha-wave/INDEX.md`
2. Check patterns in `beta-wave/_PATTERNS.md`
3. Note discoveries in `findings.md`
4. Update progress in `progress.md`

### Completing Planning

```bash
# 1. Sync findings to REM
cat findings.md >> rem/discoveries/planning.md

# 2. Create session record
cp progress.md rem/sessions/planning-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md

# 3. Update restoration protocol
echo "Last planning session: [timestamp]" >> rem/restoration/PROTOCOL.md

# 4. Suggest Brain-Wave sync
echo "Planning complete. Run 'use rem agent' to fully sync."
```

## Hooks Integration

### PreToolUse Hook
Before major file operations:
```bash
# Re-read task_plan.md to stay on track
# Check if Brain-Wave context is still loaded
# Remind of current phase and priorities
```

### PostToolUse Hook
After file writes:
```bash
# Prompt to update progress.md
# Check if discovery should be noted
# Verify alignment with plan
```

### Stop Hook
Before session ends:
```bash
# Sync findings to rem/discoveries/
# Create session snapshot in rem/sessions/
# Update rem/restoration/PROTOCOL.md
# List files that need Alpha-Wave re-index
```

## Bidirectional Sync

### Brain-Wave → Planning
```
alpha-wave/INDEX.md → task_plan.md (file references)
beta-wave/_MAP.md → task_plan.md (architecture context)
beta-wave/_PATTERNS.md → task_plan.md (pattern guidelines)
rem/discoveries/ → findings.md (prior knowledge)
rem/sessions/ → progress.md (session history)
```

### Planning → Brain-Wave
```
findings.md → rem/discoveries/planning.md
progress.md → rem/sessions/planning-[timestamp].md
task_plan.md completion → rem/restoration/PROTOCOL.md update
new patterns found → suggest beta-wave/_PATTERNS.md update
new files created → suggest alpha-wave re-index
```

## Example Session

**User**: /planning-with-files for adding user profiles

**Planning Enhanced**:
```
=== Planning with Brain-Wave Integration ===

Loading Brain-Wave context...
✓ alpha-wave/INDEX.md: 47 files indexed
✓ beta-wave/_MAP.md: Architecture loaded
✓ rem/discoveries/: 3 prior insights

Relevant context for "user profiles":
- Existing: src/models/user.ts (from index)
- Pattern: Prisma models in src/models/ (from patterns)
- Prior: Auth module works well (from discoveries)

Creating planning files...

.planning/task_plan.md
├─ Brain-Wave references included
├─ Relevant files pre-populated
├─ Patterns to follow noted
└─ Created ✓

.planning/findings.md
├─ Prior discoveries loaded
├─ Sync targets configured
└─ Created ✓

.planning/progress.md
├─ Session template ready
├─ Metrics initialized
└─ Created ✓

Ready! Your plan references Brain-Wave context.
When done, findings will sync to rem/discoveries/.
```

## Rules
- ALWAYS load Brain-Wave context at session start
- REFERENCE specific files from alpha-wave index
- PRE-POPULATE with relevant prior discoveries
- SYNC findings to rem/discoveries/ on completion
- CREATE session record in rem/sessions/
- UPDATE restoration protocol
- SUGGEST Alpha-Wave re-index for new files
